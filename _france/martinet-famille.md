1762-1841
Etching with hand colouring, 1802

This print and the one below are taken from the series Le Suprême Bon Ton; another that presented the social trends of Parisians. It included people of the height of good taste doing or wearing the latest trends. The term is ironical in this instance. The English family appear clumsy, aping good manners. Their stiff postures and the women's frumpy dresses are set against the elegant and fashionably-dressed French couple.

Marlay bequest, 1912 (34.13-192)
