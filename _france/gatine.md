1773-1831

Etching with hand colouring, c. 1815

This is the 26th plate from a series of 33 plates entitled Costumes d'Incroyables et Merveilleuses. This publication focused on portraying the fashionable men and women of the day. The inclusion of soldiers reveals to what extent they were also a common sight. This etching transgresses the standard fashion plate, however, as it merges with caricature and the tendency of French satirists to ridicule the English tourists' dress. Gatine transforms the two English soldiers into objects of mockery, employing subtle satire in showing them walking effeminately arm in arm.
