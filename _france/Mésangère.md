1761-1831

Etching with hand colouring, 1814

Le Bon Genre was another series of prints that documented fashionable Paris. It also contained some plates devoted to the English visitors. This caricaturist captures the English during their beloved habit of going for walks, which the French found incomprehensible. The men wear ridiculous flower-pot hats and ill-fitting clothes. The English women do not come off too badly this time, although they are wearing dresses with an unfashionable waistline. The fashion in Paris at that moment was to wear high-waisted, flowing dresses made of thin materials.

Marlay bequest, 1912 (34.13-235)
