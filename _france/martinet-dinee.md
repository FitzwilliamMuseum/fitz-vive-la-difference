1762-1841

Etching with hand colouring, c. 1814

Still from the same series, this print might well have been inspired by scenes of William Hogarth. It is as if the caricaturist is saying that in his opinion the national character and gross dining room habits of Englishmen had not changed in fifty years. The French were bemused by the tradition of men staying behind after dinner with the intention of drinking for drinking's sake, while their wives retired to another room.

Marlay bequest, 1912 (34.13-179)
