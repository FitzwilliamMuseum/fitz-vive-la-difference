1799-1864

Etching with hand colouring, 1814

This etching belongs to a series of caricatures that purported to be inspired from sights witnessed by a prisoner of war in London. They attempted to convey aspects of the English character. The subject of this print is rooted in a favourite preconception of the English as devoid of romantic feeling. Here, at the scene of an accident a rotund, red-faced husband has run to the aid of his horse, wilfully disregarding the health of his wife, who languishes in the arms of their ridiculously dressed son.

Given by the Friends of the Fitzwilliam Museum, 2006 (P.44-2006)
