Friends & Foes - Up he goes - Sending the Corsican Munchhausen to St Clouds

Etching with hand colouring, 1815

In this etching is an assembled party of representatives of the Powers of Europe. John Bull is front centre surrounded by (clockwise) a Dutchman, a Cossack, the Pope, a representative of Poland, Bernadotte, king of Sweden and Norway, followed by Bavaria, Austria, Prussia, Hanover, and the plump king of WÃ¼rttemberg. They toss Napoleon in a blanket. The title refers to him as the "Corsican Munchhausen" - ironically comparing him with the brave adventurer, Baron Munchausen.

Given by Cambridge in America on behalf of Michael Jaye, in memory of Mrs Angela Crookenden (P.52-2002)
