1757-1815
A Paris Beau
A Paris Belle
Etching with hand colouring, 1794

With this pair of 'portraits' Gillray visualises the new representatives of the French people.

The Paris Belle's words Je suis la Deese de la Libert√® [I am the goddess of Liberty] refer to the dechristianisation of France. At the end of 1793 the Notre Dame Cathedral had been renamed the Temple of Reason.

Given by Lady Violet Beaumont, 1948 (P.315-1948, P.316-1948)
